# Project Abstract:

The **FIC Exam Scheduler** is a web application to streamline the process by which Fraser International College (FIC) schedules and manages exams. In addition to performing the necessary business logic to generate conflict-free schedules from a given set of constraints, this application will support discrete views and workflows for administrators, instructors, and proctors. Administrative users will have the ability to manage and oversee the generated schedule, while non-administrative users will be kept informed of all relevant scheduling decisions and updates via email notifications.

Note: this repository is for the backend of this application.  The corresponding frontend repository is located at: https://github.com/fire332/exam-scheduler-backend
